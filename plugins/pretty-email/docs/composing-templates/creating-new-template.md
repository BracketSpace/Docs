# Creating New Template

**Creating beautiful email templates in WordPress** has never been easier with Pretty Email's visual template builder. You can start with professional presets or build completely custom email designs from scratch.

To create a new Pretty Email template:

1. Go to `Appearance` -> `Pretty Email`

### Sending Template Preview

You can send a preview of your template to your chosen email address, to see how it looks in your real email client (see `Preview` box at the bottom of the `Settings` sidebar)
