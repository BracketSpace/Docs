# Colors

For each template, you can set the color scheme that will be used throughout this template.

Go to `Email Template` tab in the template edit page view, and to the `Colors` section:

![Colors section](../assets/obraz-25.png)

Here you can select default color for each of 5 elements on the template.

:::note
Texts and Headings colors can always be overwritten by more specific settings inside the Text blocks.
