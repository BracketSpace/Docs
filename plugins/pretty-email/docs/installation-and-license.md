# Installation and License

### Installation

Pretty Email is available in the licensed version only, so you need to [buy access](https://bracketspace.com/downloads/pretty-email/) and download a `.zip`file to install it on your WordPress site.

If you already have your `.zip` file, upload it in the `Plugins` -> `Add New Plugin` -> `Upload Plugin`, and then activate the plugin. Otherwise, see [How to Download Plugin](#how-to-download-plugin).

4. Upload the `.zip` file as described above in [Installation](#installation).

### License

Once you have installed and activated the plugin, go to the plugin's settings to provide a license key. Without it, the templates will not be rendered, so you will not be able to use them.

1. Go to `Appearance` -> `Pretty Email`
