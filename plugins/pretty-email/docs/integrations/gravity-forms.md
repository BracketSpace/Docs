# Gravity Forms

If you use Notifications in the Gravity Form plugin, you can wrap them up in the Pretty Email template.

1.  Go to the `Notifications` tab in your GF form settings

3.  At the bottom of the notification edit screen, you can choose the template that you want to use

You can choose one of 3 options:

1. No email template - if you don't want to use any Pretty Email template on this notification
2. Default Pretty Email template - if you want to use whichever template is set up as default in the PE settings (see [WordPress](wordpress.md) integration)
3. Specifically, choose one of your saved templates

:::note
Remember to put an Email Body block in the chosen template for the email to contain the message set in the notification.
