## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I use different templates for different contact forms?**

A: Currently, the WordPress integration applies one default template to all Contact Form 7 emails. For form-specific templates, consider using our [Gravity Forms integration](gravity-forms.md) which offers more granular control.

**Q: Will this work with Contact Form 7 add-ons?**

A: Yes, Pretty Email works with most CF7 add-ons since it processes the final email output. However, complex add-ons that modify email structure may require testing.

**Q: Does this affect email delivery rates?**

A: Pretty Email can improve engagement but doesn't directly affect deliverability. For better delivery rates, use an SMTP service like SendGrid or Mailgun.

**Q: Can I include images in my Contact Form 7 emails?**

A: Yes, you can add images to your Pretty Email templates. User-uploaded images from file upload fields will be handled according to your CF7 configuration.

**Q: Is there a way to preview emails before sending?**

A: You can preview your templates in the Pretty Email editor, but for full Contact Form 7 integration testing, submit actual test forms to see the complete email output.
