# Text Watermark Placeholders

**Text watermark placeholders** are dynamic tags that automatically insert real content into your watermarks when applied to WordPress images. These powerful variables allow you to create personalized watermarks with information like dates, user names, or custom data that changes automatically for each watermarked image.

A placeholder is a simple dynamic tag that's replaced with real content while a watermark is applied. It looks like this:

```
%placeholder%
```

The plugin comes with a bunch of predefined placeholders, but you can define your own.
