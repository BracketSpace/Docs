# How to Add Watermarks to WordPress Images

**Adding watermarks to WordPress images** is essential for protecting your photos and maintaining brand identity. Easy Watermark provides two convenient methods: watermarking individual images for precise control, or bulk watermarking multiple images simultaneously to save time.

## If you want to watermark just one image:

1. Go to the Media Library

2. Click on the chosen image to open the Attachment details page

3. Go to "Edit more details"
