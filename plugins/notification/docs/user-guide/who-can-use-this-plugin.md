# Who Should Use WordPress Notification Plugin

**WordPress Notification plugin is designed for both beginners and developers** who need automated email notifications, custom triggers, and extensible notification systems. Whether you're managing a simple blog or building complex WordPress applications, this plugin adapts to your notification needs.

The Notification plugin is designed to be easy to setup even for beginner users. If you are familiar with WordPress dashboard you'll find the Notification plugin very intuitive.

It has a bunch of [predefined Triggers](../../developer/triggers/default-triggers) you can use and which will work out of the box.

But the plugin is not limited to "clicky-click" in WordPress dashboard. It's [very extensible](../../developer/general/extension-possibilities) and developers can use it as a notification framework in their own plugins or themes.

This opens a lot of possibilities. Developers can do their thing and the users can still use the easy and unified interface to edit the Notifications.

Example? You could send a pidgeon to your friend when someone clicks a button on your website. But you'd have to find the API for pidgeon submission first
