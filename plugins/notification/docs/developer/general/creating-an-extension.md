# How to Create WordPress Notification Plugin Extensions

**WordPress Notification plugin extension development** is a straightforward process that enables developers to create custom functionality and publish it on WordPress.org. This comprehensive guide covers extension creation best practices, naming conventions, and development workflows for building professional-grade notification extensions.

For more details, see [Extension Possibilities](extension-possibilities.md).

## Quickstart

For your convenience, we created extension boilerplate. You will find it on [GitHub](https://github.com/BracketSpace/Notification-Extension-Boilerplate).

With such a boilerplate you can be sure to follow our standards but most importantly â€“ you can start your extension blazing fast.

## Naming

We are following specific naming convention which is: **Notification : Something**.

The namespace should follow the general format which is: **BracketSpace/Notification/Something**.

The _Something_ is the part where you place your extension's name.

Take a look at existing extensions, like [Notification : Signature](https://wordpress.org/plugins/signature-notification/) or [Notification : bbPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/notification-bbpress/).

## Releasing the plugin

If your plugin is free and released on WordPress.org you can [let us know](https://bracketspace.com/contact/) about your awesome work. After review we will place your plugin in the Notification's Extension Directory!
