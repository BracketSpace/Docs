# Who can use this plugin

The Notification plugin is designed to be easy to setup even for beginner users. If you are familiar with WordPress dashboard you'll find the Notification plugin very intuitive.

[How to create Notifications](./how-to-create-notifications)

It has a bunch of [predefined Triggers](../developer/triggers/default-triggers) you can use and which will work out of the box.

But the plugin is not limited to "clicky-click" in WordPress dashboard. It's [very extensible](../developer/general/extension-possibilities) and developers can use it as a framework in their own plugins or themes.

This opens a lot of possibilities. Developers can do their thing and the users can still use the easy and unified interface to edit the Notifications.

Example? You could send a pidgeon to your friend when someone clicks a button on your website. But you'd have to find the API for pidgeon submission first
