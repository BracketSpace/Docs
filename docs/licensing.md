# Licensing

All BracketSpace paid plugins are subject to licensed usage. A valid license ensures you receive premium support, one year of automatic updates, and a safe place to download the plugin.

## License Purchase

Licenses can be purchased at [bracketspace.com](https://bracketspace.com). Each license is tied to a specific domain and provides access to:

- **Premium Support**: Direct support from our team
- **Automatic Updates**: One year of plugin updates
- **Secure Downloads**: Safe and trusted download source

## Domain-Based Licensing

Licensing works on a per-domain basis, meaning each license is valid for one production domain. However, development and test domains are excluded from license usage and do not count towards your license limit.

### Development Domains

The following domain types are automatically excluded and won't consume your license:
- Local development environments (localhost, .local, .test, .dev)
- Staging and testing subdomains
- Development servers and test sites

This allows you to freely test and develop with our plugins without worrying about license restrictions.
